> Official website for Multiformats http://multiformats.io

This repository contains the source code for the Multiformats website available at http://multiformats.io

This project builds out a static site to explain Multiformats, ready for deployment on ipfs. It uses `hugo` to glue the html together. It provides an informative, public-facing website. The most important things are the words, concepts and links it presents.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/multiformats/website.git
```

## Usage

To deploy the site multiformats.io, run:

```sh
# Build out the optimised site to ./public, where you can check it locally.
make

```

The following commands are available:

### `make`

Build the optimised site to the `./public` dir

### `make serve`

Preview the production ready site at http://localhost:1313

### `make dev`

Start a hot-reloading dev server on http://localhost:1313

## Deploying the site

If you want to deploy the site to IPFS locally, you can run `ipfs add --cid-version 1 -r -q public  | tail -n1` add the website to your local IPFS instance and then access it at your local IPFS gateway URL, e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8080/ipfs/${CID}

The production site is deployed to https://multiformats.io using https://fleek.co/ when new changes are merged to the repo at https://github.com/multiformats/website.

---

See the `Makefile` for the full list or run `make help` in the project root. You can pass the env var `DEBUG=true` to increase the verbosity of your chosen command.

## Dependencies
